0. About
--------
buildy is an automatic nightly builder. Given a VCS repository and a
packaging template it can create distribution packages of your software.

1. VCS
------
Currently buildy supports SVN and Git as VCS. Git branches are not
supported yet.

2. Distributions
----------------
Currently buildy supports only Debian (and Ubuntu and other dpkg/deb-using
ones) as target distribution. Support for other (RPM-based) distributions
will come later.

3. Usage
--------
Ask Zhenech in #geany on irc.freenode.net - too lazy now ;)
